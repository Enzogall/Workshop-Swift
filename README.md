# Introduction to Swift Programming

Welcome to this accessible introduction to Swift programming! In the following sections, we have curated a collection of exercises specifically tailored to help you understand and master the fundamental concepts of Swift.

## Compilation and Execution
We will be using [SwiftFiddle](https://swiftfiddle.com/ "SwiftFiddle"), an online Swift compiler. This platform is ideal for beginners as it allows you to write and run Swift code directly from your browser without the need for any local setup. 

## Exercise 1:

Write a program that uses a loop to print every number from 1 to 100.

## Exercise 2:

Create a function that adds two integers and returns the result. The function should take two parameters:

- The first integer to be added.
- The second integer to be added.

## Exercise 3:

Write a function to reverse a string and return the reversed string. The function should take one parameter:

- The string to reverse.

## Exercise 4:

Create a function that counts how many words are in a sentence. The function should take one parameter:

- The sentence to analyze.

## Exercise 5:

Write a function in that calculates the average of an array of numbers. The function should take one parameter:

- An array of integers.

## Exercise 6:

Implement a function that returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The function should take one parameter:

- The position n in the Fibonacci sequence.

## Final Task:

Develop a text analyzer tool that takes a text input and outputs various statistics about the text. This tool should implement the following functionalities:

- **Word Count**: Count the number of words in the text.
- **Average Word Length**: Calculate the average length of the words in the text.
- **Most Frequent Word**: Find the most frequent word in the text.

Use the functions developed in previous exercises and combine them into a new function `analyzeText`, which should take one parameter:

- The text to analyze.
